# Side Project Forum

This is a forum built with React, SASS and CSS, Socket.io, Express, MongoDB. Data for demo is generated by python scripts in /forum/scripts folder.

I have deployed the website on [https://forum.htchenlisa.com/](https://forum.htchenlisa.com/). I have also set up CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins on my server. [I](https://github.com/owlhtchen) pair-programmed some parts of the project with [another classmate](https://github.com/shiinamiyuki) and had some teamwork experience.

## Check it on

Github: [https://github.com/owlhtchen/forum](https://github.com/owlhtchen/forum)

Deployed website: [https://forum.htchenlisa.com/](https://forum.htchenlisa.com/), you can login with email w@w.com and password w. I have registered accounts with email matching regex regex ([a-z]{1, 5})@[a-z].com and correspoding password [a-z] for demonstration purpose, e.g. you can login in with:

- email w@w.com and password: w
- email ww@w.com and password: w
- email www@w.com and password: w
- email wwww@w.com and password: w
- email wwwww@w.com and password: w

Substitube letter 'w' in the examples above with any letter from a to z should work as well.
